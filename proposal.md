# Proposal

## What will (likely) be the title of your project?

Pip's Adventure (Game)

## In just a sentence or two, summarize your project. (E.g., "A website that lets you buy and sell stocks.")

A game starring a basic sprite that I made named Pip who goes through a level and has to collect his sword and fight enemies.

## In a paragraph or more, detail your project. What will your software do? What features will it have? How will it be executed?

I want to make a game that has Pip go through and fight enemies that will be placed throughout the level. I plan on making most of the sprites myself and I am not an artist so be warned! Pip will fight through these enemies using either his bare hands or his sword if he has collected. He needs to take care of all the enemies to finish the stage he is on. Ideally I would like to make multiple levels but I don't know how fast I will be able to get this up and running and if that will be a possiblility. It will be a rather basic game and most of the basic movement will probably be built off of the mario lab we have due in the coming week. 

## If planning to combine 1051's final project with another course's final project, with which other course? And which aspect(s) of your proposed project would relate to 1051, and which aspect(s) would relate to the other course?

N/A

## If planning to collaborate with 1 or 2 classmates for the final project, list their names, email addresses, and the names of their assigned TAs below.

N/A

## In the world of software, most everything takes longer to implement than you expect. And so it's not uncommon to accomplish less in a fixed amount of time than you hope.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a GOOD outcome for your final project. I.e., what WILL you accomplish no matter what?

One functioning level with working combat and enemies that you must clear to beat the level.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BETTER outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you THINK you can accomplish before the final project's deadline?

A functioning level like in the last part with working animations and the sword concept that I described earlier.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BEST outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you HOPE to accomplish before the final project's deadline?

Multiple levels that have working animations and game mechanics as I plan with enemies fully animated just like Pip will be. 

## In a paragraph or more, outline your next steps. What new skills will you need to acquire? What topics will you need to research? If working with one of two classmates, who will do what?

As of right now, I am working on the sprites for Pip in game. A basic standing model along with basic 2 frame walking animation and attack animations. I will then look into implementing these into the mario code to see Pip jump around and move and stuff like I want him to. Then I'll try to get the attacking funtions to work and enemies put in. Basically, I am going to start with basic movement and work onto the combat system. I'll need to look into how collison in lua works if I want this combat to work.
